# DuckHunt
Duck Hunt mobile app game made for a mobile apps programming class. It is not intended to go on the appstore due to obvious copyright issues. 
This was made as the final project for the class. The game works for two rounds. To use, you need to have Corona simulator installed and run it as an ipad air.
